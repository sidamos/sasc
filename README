Due to 'Hollywood' legislation, the use of this software is illegal in most countrys!

The purpose of this git repo is to make FFDECSA (via sasc's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.

You can use it with kernel version 3.x and up, including more recent kernels (3.7.x and up)

dvbdev.h is included for all cases, so you must not set --dvb_dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. This setting is now reserved for use in case that you have to compile and install newest dvb drivers from v4l. Mind you, if you do, you should apply proper dvb-mutex patch to your v4l sources prior to compiling.


If you are running Debian with a Debian kernel, you don't need to recompile your kernel anymore, the running kernel will be properly patched. That is, if your sources.list is ok and the source for your Debian kernel is available from the repo's.

USAGE:
git clone https://github.com/bas-t/sasc.git
cd sasc/contrib/sasc-ng
./configure <opts>
make && make module

If you know what FFDECSA optimisation is best for you, you can set it like:

./configure --compiletype=release --ffdecsa_mode=PARALLEL_128_SSE
